											<h1>Interdisciplinary & Collaborative</h1>
											<p>Mixing biology with mathematics, engineering and computing</p>
										</header>
										<p>
											As with any biological engineering group, we take the Richard Feynman quote 
											"What I cannot create, I do not understand" as scripture. While 
											developing a greater understanding of existing biological systems, we also
											aim to develop new systems that can help to solve some of the key 
											challenges facing the world.
											To do this we combine wet and dry lab work to explore three 
											inter-related areas: microbial communities, self-organisation, and 
											quantitative methods.
										</p>
										<!-- <p>
											We try to understand biological systems by building them. 
											Whether we want to treat disease with live bio-therapeutics, produce 
											valuable chemicals in a bio-reactor, or bio-remediate polluted 
											environments; we can use computational modelling alongside tools and 
											techniques from molecular- and micro-biology to create new living systems.
