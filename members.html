										<b>Alex J H Fedorec</b>
										Group leader
										<em>he/him</em>
										<br>
										I am a new group leader (assistant professor/lecturer) in the Division of Biosciences 
										at University College London, UK. My research involves applying computational and 
										mathematical techniques to understand and engineer new biological systems. I 
										am particularly interested in biotherapeutic and bioindustrial applications of 
										biological engineering with a focus on creating stable and 
										predictable synthetic microbial communities in complex environments, such as 
										the gastrointestinal tract.
										<br>
										<br>
										I was previously a Research Fellow in the 
										<a href="https://ucl-cssb.github.io/"> Computational Systems and Synthetic Biology</a> 
										group in the Department of 
										Cell & Developmental Biology at University College London, UK. 
										I have a background in computer science and industrial experience as a 
										software engineer at Research in Motion (now BlackBerry).

										<b>Alice Cook</b>
										PhD student 2023-										
										<br>
										I am a PhD student on the London Interdisciplinary Biosciences Consortium DTP 
										(LIDo). My research will look at motility, patterning, and information 
										processing in cellular communities, as part of the Fedorec group at UCL and 
										the Bentley group at the Francis Crick Institute. Previously, I completed a 
										BASc in Arts and Sciences at UCL. I also completed a PhD rotation project in 
										the Pearce and Barnes groups at UCL looking at experimental and computational 
										design of self-organised patterning via chemical signalling in microbial 
										communities, and a further rotation project with the Logan group (King's 
										College London) and Bentley group on fibroblast, ECM, and muscle fibre 
										disorganisation in congenital limb abnormalities using wet-lab and agent-based 
										modelling approaches.

										<b>Yue (Casey) Chen</b>
										PhD student	2023-
										<br>								
										I am a PhD student on the EPSCR CDT BioDesign Engineering program. I am 
										interested in engineering biological systems so they perform as we desire. My 
										current project focuses on tunning microbial interactions to establish 
										microbial communities and using computational tools to predict and design them. 
										Before joining the group, I worked as a research assistant at the Chinese 
										Academy of Sciences (SIAT), focusing on the characterisation of a 
										biofilm-derived electroconductive protein. I completed an MRes in Systems and 
										Synthetic Biology at Imperial College London and BSc in Molecular Genetics at 
										the University of Edinburgh.

										<b>Louie Destouches</b>
										PhD student 2023-
										<em>he/him</em>	
										<br>							
										I am a PhD student on the UCL EPSRC DTP program exploring the robustness of 
										synthetic microbial communities to environmental factors. I grew up in France 
										and moved to the UK for my Bachelor's in Biological Sciences with one year 
										abroad in Hong Kong. I returned to Paris for a Masters focused on Systems and 
										Synthetic Biology at the Learning Planet Institute/Université Paris Cité with 
										research projects at INRAE, Institut Curie and Institut Pasteur. I was also 
										team leader of the 2022 Paris-Bettencourt team for the international synthetic 
										biology iGEM competition, where we built interfaces between bacterial genetics 
										and electronics. Beyond my research, I have an interest in aquaponics and am a 
										member of the Center of Art and Ecology at the University of Goldmiths, where 
										I teach microbiology practicals to artists. For my PhD project, I work with 
										bacteria and yeast communities, understanding how these different communities 
										behave in response to changes in their environment, and leveraging those 
										mechanisms to control community dynamics.

										<b>David Gao</b>
										MSci Computational Biology 2025-26
										<br>							
										I am a 3rd year Msci Computational Biology(Biological Sciences) student and am 
										doing my investigative project here. I have strong interests in Artificial 
										Intelligence. My project would involve interpreting protein language models by 
										processing output from each attention layer, of PLMs based on different 
										architecture,  into small downstream heads to see if language models 
										understand protein properties or if they still remain relative ‘black boxes’.  
										I think this would allow biologists to develop more trust for PLMs. I 
										previously did research at Ziheng Yang’s lab to compare statistical properties 
										of coalescent programs and have a publication coming up as a result. I am 
										Chinese but was educated in UK since 10, so I’m fluent in both languages and 
										love both cultures. In my free time I really enjoy doing Brazilian Jiujitsu.

										BSc Biological Sciences 2025-26
										<br>							
										I am an undergraduate student in Biological Sciences at University College 
										London, currently completing my final year research project in the group. My 
										interests lie in computational biology and data science, with a focus on

										MSci Biological Sciences 2025-26
										<br>							
										I am a final-year MSci Biological Sciences student at UCL, specializing in 
										Cell Biology. My research interests include space biology, extremophiles, and 
										sustainable biotechnology. Currently, my master’s project will be focusing on 
										AI-guided nutrient control for stabilizing synthetic microbial co-cultures, 
										integrating deep reinforcement learning models into continuous bioreactor 
										systems.

										<b>Andrej Mitrovic</b>
										BSc Biological Sciences 2025-26
										<br>							
										I am an undergraduate studying Biomedical Sciences as my major stream and 
										mathematics and statistics as my minor. I am particularly interested in 
										immunology and applying computational approaches to study the gut microbiome 
										and its role in autoimmune disease. I previously gained experience in machine 
										learning during a statistics internship at AstraZeneca. I am now building on 
										this in my third-year literature project, which explores machine learning 
										applications for microbiome-based diagnostics.
